Work Experience
---------

*   **2012.4-present, Director of R&D** , JiangNan institute of computing technology, Beijing department 


	* Manage the research center's technical roadmap and execution of features and scalability.
	* Lead the team of 20 people, to do projects related in linux kernel and driver, security.
	* Improve the  performance and stablity of Multicore operating system, pass the test orignized by authority.
	* Complete information authority system and file tranfer system in which security technologies such as symmetric/asymmetric cryptography are used.

*   **2007.7-2012.3, R&D Engineer**, JiangNan institute of computing technology

	***Multicore operating system, project leader***

	* Lead the team to complete this project, including pre-research,project establishment, technology plan,design,code and test.
	* Combine technologies in virtualizaion,single system image and cluster operating system, design an extensible multicore operating system on native 16-core processer, pass the LTP(Linux Test Project).
	* Linear speedup can be achieved when running  process level application under the multicore operating system.

	***Virtual Machine Manager(VMM), core member***

	* In charge of the SWVMM IO module. Subproject of "Virtualization of calculation systems - basic theory and practice" which is one of the "National Basic Research Program of China"(973).
	* Design paravirtualizaion io model and pass-through io model, improve performance by using technologies such as direct-copy which are support by native processer.
	* Access device(netcard) in guest os: performance loss of 5% under paravirtualizaion io model, 1% under pass-through io model.

	***Kernel and driver of native processor, core member***

	* In charge of the linux kernel IO model. This project design os for native processor.
	* Design and port PCI subsystem,sata subsystem, audio and video subsystem, usb subsystem and so on,support few motherboards.
	* Optimise and improve the IO performance. Such as point out insufficiency of the  CPU's lock instruction, propose improvement in the next processor, which case the file read speed from 20MB/s to 100MB/s.


	***"RuiSi" BIOS, project leader***

	* In charge of BIOS for native processor.
	* Design and code for system boot process(network boot,disk boot,CD/DVD boot), VGA display, Trusted Boot process based on TCM.
	* Optimise boot process, cut start time from 30s to 12s.

	***"RuiSi" Linux distribution, core member***

	* In charge of Linux distribution for native processor.
	* Build the architecture of "RuiSi" Linux dist based on RPM tools.Port and optimise the Xorg subsystem.
	* GUI interface(KDE) and audio/video play have been achieved for the first time in native processor.
